cbmSD-mini - SD Card Drive for Commodore Computers with IEEE
============================================================

Webpage: http://www.6502.org/users/sjgray/projects/cbmsd/index.html

The goal of this project is to create a free open-source
disk drive solution that ie easy to build using all
thru-hole parts plus the use of a common inexpensive SD
card module.

This device is based on the petSD+ v2.4 from Nils Eilers.
I have removed all the non-essential features and have
designed it to plug directly into the back of the computer.
No IEEE cables are required. However, if it also has a
pass-thru to add additional drives if you need.

You will need a simple cassette port power plug or you can
power it with a standard 5V adapter with barrel jack.

Features
--------

- Direct plug into IEEE port
- Pass-thru IEEE port
- Power, Busy and Error lights
- SD module can be mounted on header or extended via wires.
- Reset switch.
- Two Power headers for input or output (to additional
  cbmSD-mini units.
- Mounting holes for future 3D case.


Status
------

cbmSD-mini V1 was the first version for prototyping. It had 
a few errors. These have been corrected for V1.1. Additionally,
V1 had an IEC port and AUX header. These have been dropped to
simplify the design and to make it IEEE only for PET/CBM users.

The gerbers have been sent to the board house on 2021-05-14.
When they arrive I will verify complete operation. I suggest
WAITING before making your own boards. Check the project webpage
(listed above) for more information.

I also have another design in testing. This will be "cbmSD". It
is like the V1 prototype, with IEC and has additional features.
Check the webpage for updates.
